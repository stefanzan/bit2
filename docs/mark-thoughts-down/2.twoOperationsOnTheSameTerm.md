## Problem statement 

Given the following template:
`«var paragraphs=[{headline:"Greeting", text:"Good Morning"},{headline:"Weather", text:"Sunny"}]»
<html>
  <body>
  «for p in paragraphs separator "</div><div>" front "<div>" rear "</div>"»
    «if p.headline!=null»
    <h1>«p.headline»</h1>
    «endif»
    <p>
    «p.text»
    </p>
  «endfor»
  </body>
</html>`

It generates the output as:
`
<html>
  <body>
  <div>
    
    <h1>Greeting</h1>
    
    <p>
    Good Morning
    </p>
  </div><div>
    
    <h1>Weather</h1>
    
    <p>
    Sunny
    </p>
  </div>
  </body>
</html>`

If we want to divide "</div><div>", we may using two operations: bulk(insert "\n" at 99, insert "  " at 100).
But it will fail during backward transformation, why?

Because two update operations works on the same term separator("</div><div>"), after the first update operation done, the term is updated to "</div>\n<div>", and the second update operation's position becomes -5, and continues to update the remaining terms, not this one.

In this case, we shall go back to this term and update it again.

Fuse.ts line 1918 
position: op.position - deltaN 

Because we have the assumption that the ops in a bulk must be in order.  If the second op's position becomes negative, the rest may or may not.

When facing negative position, go back one step.
